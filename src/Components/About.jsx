        </h1>
        <p className="text-md md:text-lg">
         I am a passionate <span className="font-bold text-indigo-500">UI/UX Designer</span>  with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from K.S.Institute of Technology, Bangalore.  
          <br />
          <br />
          I have gained valuable experience through internships at <span className="font-bold text-indigo-500">Samartha Info Solutions</span> and <span className="font-bold text-indigo-500">Brihat InfoTech Private Limited.</span>
          <br />
          <br />These opportunities have allowed me to develop and refine my skills in creating innovative and user-centric digital experiences.
          My hands-on experience includes proficiency in Figma for designing interfaces, creating prototypes, and developing design systems.
          I have expertise in designing responsive interfaces, user-friendly dashboards, and implementing cohesive design systems.
          Throughout my internships, I've demonstrated a keen eye for design, a strong understanding of user-centered design principles,
          and the ability to translate complex requirements into intuitive, visually appealing interfaces. My work has consistently focused on enhancing user experience,
          improving engagement metrics, and reducing user errors through thoughtful design solutions.
          This experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in UI/UX design principles and practices, as well as
          practical skills in industry-standard tools and methodologies, preparing me for challenging roles in the field of digital design.
